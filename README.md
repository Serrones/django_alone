I have created a Django website guided by the Django Tutorial in
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01

It's very interesting the way that the tutorial teaches, simple and fast,
things to build a basic and functional website application. And more, this
tutorial shows us the path for a better understanding about any tool with
the Django Docs, and gives a special attention with the Python best practices
for development.

Why don't you try?
